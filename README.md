# Java-Book-My-Show
Book My Show is a flexible and robust modern-day ticketing app built especially for movies. It can be used by users to view and book movie tickets and also check their availability from a given set of available movies. The booking can be completed only once a user a registered and he/she has completed and proceeded with the payment step successfully. Henceforth, the transactions, details of the movies and user account details will be stored and managed using an appropriate database system. Thus, the project will allow an easy-to-use interface for the users to perform the checking, availability and booking of movie tickets. This project report covers purpose of the project, system architecture, overview of the project, literature survey, and system analysis and system requirements. Specific Technology Used • MySQL ( Back-end ) • Java • Java Swing ( Front-End GUI ) • JDBC Plug-in for SQL Connectivity.

# Project Tasks 
• Draw ER diagram, 
• Key attributes, Non-key attributes, Primary key identification, 
• Data base design has to be done. 
• Front-end and back end, finalization along with connectivity.

# Functional components of the project: The GUI’S at the top level have been categorized as

# Administrative user interface ( Movie Details management)
1.The operational or generic user interface (User/Client End) The ‘administrative user interface’ concentrates on the consistent information which needs proper authentication for the data collection. These interfaces help the administrators with all the transactional states like Data insertion, Data deletion and Date updation along with the extensive data search capabilities like ‘Adding New Movies’ and ‘Updating the database of the users’. The ‘operational or generic user interface’ helps the end users of the system in transactions through the existing data and required services. This module helps the customer to view and book the movie tickets. The operational user interface also helps the ordinary users in managing their own information in a customized manner as per the included flexibilities. Number of Modules: After careful analysis the system has been identified to have the following modules:
2.Movies Details Module
3.User Registration Module
4.User Login Module
5.User Ticket-Booking Module
6.Administrative Page Module Submission The project presentation has to be done by each member to show periodically the progress and the complete project submission should contain the following: • ER diagram:- key attributes , non key attributes, and primary key identification. • The project could be extended depending on the functionalities of the project as follows: o If time permits, we also hope to incorporate media files like Movie Trailers as the part of the tables inside our database, by storing their relative links, and using these references to embed the media files inside the design of our Swing GUI, to make the project more appealing, using the Java VideoPlayer library class.
